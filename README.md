# Planet Geo Navigation 


WebGl application that use geographic coordinate to navigate.

This app uses ThreeJS Library to manipulate WebGl and TweenJS to animate the transitions between locations, eather in the space view or the geo cordinates.

Webpack is used for module bundler.

BulmaCSS is being used for component layout.
